This project hosts the code for implementing the CIM algorithm for weakly supervised instance segmentation.

## Quick View
Since running the code requires preparing a lot of data, if you just want to understand how we implement CIM, you can directly choose to read the paper and the following code.
- **Paper** [[Paper](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2023/0127.pdf)]
- **Pipeline** [[code](./lib/modeling/model_builder.py)]
- **CIM Strategy** [[code](./lib/modeling/heads.py)]

## Installation
Please follow the instructions in [INSTALL.md](./docs/INSTALL.md).

## Preparation
Please follow the instructions in [DATASET.md](./docs/DATASET.md).

## Experiments
Before starting the experiment. You need to update these four values ```cfg_file, output_file, dataset, iter_time``` according to your needs. 
### Training
```bash
bash ./scripts/train_CIM.sh
```

### Evaluation
```bash
bash ./scripts/eval_CIM.sh
```

### Mask R-CNN Refinement
```bash
# generate pseudo labels from CIM for training Mask R-CNN
bash ./scripts/generate_msrcnn_label.sh
```
Then, we use mmdetection for Mask R-CNN Refinement.

### Visualization
```bash
bash ./scripts/visual_result_mmcv.sh
```
